    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Japanese curry is a staple food. You can eat Japanese curry at chains like Coco Ichibanya, Curry House (just kidding, Curry House is gone...), or a lot of ramen restaurants. 
        I've had Japanese curry more times I could count, but I never realized how easy and cheap it was to make until I came to Las Vegas. With about $10 worth of ingredients and a kitchen,
        you can make 4 servings for your friends, family, or yourself!

    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>rice (up to you)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 ¾ pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>3 onions, quartered</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>4 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon (Optional)</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, cut into 3-inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 ½ (3.5 ounce) containers Japanese curry roux, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.</li>
        <li>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
