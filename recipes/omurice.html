    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ever crave for Omurice (Japanese omelet rice)? In romance anime, the school festivals, maid cafes, and family restaurants all portray omurice as a delectable dish. Topped 
        with a heart made out of ketchup, your mouth salivates in anticipation when you look at the omurice. Just kidding. In anime, omurice is more about the maids than the actual dish.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the United States, usually restaurants that serve Omurice aren't that popular and tend to go out of business. For Omurice fans like me, this is bad news. In the past, I've had two favorite Omurice restaurants that I would go at least once 
        every two weeks. Those two restaurants (the one in Mitsuwa and Curry House) went out of business... The only other Omurice place I still go to is Red Rock.
        <br />
        <br />
        Anyway, enough about the depressing talk, my job is to teach you how to make omurice, so you can start up an omurice restaurant that makes omurice into the mainstream US culture. Let's begin.

    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cooked white or brown rice</li>
        <li>2 thin slices cooked ham, cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Add the cooked rice, 2 tablespoons ketchup and ham. Cook and stir until the ingredients are well combined 
            and heated through, about 8 minutes. Scoop the mixture onto a serving bowl and shape into an oval.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, beat eggs and salt and pepper. Heat a small skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Add egg mixture; cook over medium heat. As eggs set, lift edges,
             letting uncooked portion flow underneath. Use a spatula to gently fold the eggs into a cocoon shape. When eggs are completely set, remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Place the omelet on top of the rice and run a knife length-wise through the top layer of the omelet. It should open like a butterfly and drape over the rice. 
            Top with the final tablespoon of ketchup and a sprinkle of parsley.</li>
    </ol>
